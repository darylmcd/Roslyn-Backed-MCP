# Runtime

<!-- purpose: Build/test/run commands, execution context, and Roslyn MCP client policy. -->

This document is the canonical runtime and execution-context reference for AI agents and maintainers.

## Execution Context

- Primary runtime target: local stdio host process.
- Workspace model: `MSBuildWorkspace` over on-disk files.
- Unsaved editor buffers are not authoritative for semantic operations.

## Task Runner

All commands below are available as `just` recipes. Run `just --list` for the full menu, or `just ci` to run the complete local CI gate.

| Recipe | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| `just build` | Debug build |
| `just test` | Full test suite |
| `just validate` | Fast local check (build + test) |
| `just ci` | Mirrors CI pipeline (docs + release validation + vuln audit) |
| `just run` | Start the stdio host process |
| `just reinstall` | Full reinstall: Layer 1 (global tool) + Layer 2 (Claude Code plugin) |
| `just tool-install-local` | Layer 1 only: pack + install global tool from local build |
| `just plugin-reload` | Layer 2 only: reload Claude Code plugin from local repo |

See `justfile` in the repo root for the complete recipe list including packaging, Docker, and security audit recipes.

## Platform And Tooling

- .NET SDK: 10.0.100 (rollForward: latestFeature) — see `global.json`
- Primary v1 operating system target: Windows. Cross-platform (macOS, Linux) supported wherever .NET 10 SDK is available.
- Main local validation entry point: `just ci` (or `./eng/verify-release.ps1` directly)
- Fast manual commands:
  - `just build` / `dotnet build RoslynMcp.slnx --nologo`
  - `just test` / `dotnet test RoslynMcp.slnx --nologo`
  - `just run` / `dotnet run --project src/RoslynMcp.Host.Stdio`

## Package Identity

- **NuGet package ID:** `Darylmcd.RoslynMcp` (NOT `RoslynMcp` — that is a different publisher's package)
- **CLI command after install:** `roslynmcp`
- **Install:** `dotnet tool install -g Darylmcd.RoslynMcp`
- **Update:** `dotnet tool update -g Darylmcd.RoslynMcp`

The project name `RoslynMcp.Host.Stdio` is the .csproj assembly name, not the NuGet package ID. Always use `Darylmcd.RoslynMcp` in `dotnet tool` commands.

## Environment variables (stdio host)

Optional overrides read at startup from `src/RoslynMcp.Host.Stdio/Program.cs`. Values must be positive integers unless noted.

| Variable | Affects | Default (when unset) |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| `ROSLYNMCP_MAX_WORKSPACES` | `WorkspaceManagerOptions.MaxConcurrentWorkspaces` | 8 |
| `ROSLYNMCP_MAX_SOURCE_GENERATED_DOCS` | `WorkspaceManagerOptions.MaxSourceGeneratedDocuments` | 500 |
| `ROSLYNMCP_BUILD_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `ValidationServiceOptions.BuildTimeout` | 5 minutes |
| `ROSLYNMCP_TEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `ValidationServiceOptions.TestTimeout` | 10 minutes |
| `ROSLYNMCP_VULN_SCAN_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `ValidationServiceOptions.VulnerabilityScanTimeout` | 2 minutes |
| `ROSLYNMCP_MAX_RELATED_FILES` | `ValidationServiceOptions.MaxRelatedFiles` | 25 |
| `ROSLYNMCP_FAST_FAIL_FILE_LOCK` | When unset or `true`, `test_run` terminates the child `dotnet test` on the first MSB3027/MSB3021 line so the FailureEnvelope returns within ~200ms instead of ~10s. Set to `false` to restore pre-v1.17 behavior (wait for MSBuild's 10× retry loop). | `true` |
| `ROSLYNMCP_PREVIEW_MAX_ENTRIES` | `PreviewStoreOptions.MaxEntries` | 20 |
| `ROSLYNMCP_PREVIEW_TTL_MINUTES` | `PreviewStoreOptions.TtlMinutes` | 5 minutes |
| `ROSLYNMCP_PREVIEW_PERSIST_DIR` | `PreviewStoreOptions.PersistDirectory` — when set, composite preview tokens are written to disk so a separate `roslynmcp` process (e.g. an apply-phase sub-agent) can redeem them. Solution-backed previews stay in-memory only. | unset (in-memory only) |
| `ROSLYNMCP_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS` | `ExecutionGateOptions.RateLimitMaxRequests` | 120 |
| `ROSLYNMCP_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_SECONDS` | `ExecutionGateOptions.RateLimitWindow` | 60 |
| `ROSLYNMCP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `ExecutionGateOptions.RequestTimeout` | 120 |
| `ROSLYNMCP_ON_STALE` | `ExecutionGateOptions.OnStale` — stale-workspace policy (`auto-reload`, `warn`, `off`) | `auto-reload` |
| `ROSLYNMCP_PATH_VALIDATION_FAIL_OPEN` | `SecurityOptions.PathValidationFailOpen` | `false` (must parse as `true`/`false` to override) |
| `ROSLYNMCP_SCRIPT_MAX_CONCURRENT` | `ScriptingServiceOptions.MaxConcurrentEvaluations` | 4 (FLAG-5C: max in-flight `evaluate_csharp` calls racing their hard deadline) |
| `ROSLYNMCP_SCRIPT_SLOT_WAIT_SECONDS` | `ScriptingServiceOptions.ConcurrencySlotAcquireTimeoutSeconds` | 5 seconds |
| `ROSLYNMCP_SCRIPT_MAX_ABANDONED` | `ScriptingServiceOptions.MaxAbandonedEvaluations` | 8 (FLAG-5C: abandoned-worker-thread cap; restart host when hit) |
| `ROSLYNMCP_SCRIPT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `ScriptingServiceOptions.TimeoutSeconds` | 10 seconds |
| `ROSLYNMCP_SCRIPT_WATCHDOG_GRACE_SECONDS` | `ScriptingServiceOptions.WatchdogGraceSeconds` | 10 seconds (hard-kill grace after the script budget expires) |

## Claude Code Plugin

The server is also distributed as a Claude Code plugin. Plugin-relevant configuration:

- `.mcp.json` passes user-configurable env vars via `${user_config.*}` placeholders to the `roslynmcp` process.
- `hooks/hooks.json` defines PreToolUse and PostToolUse hooks for safety enforcement.
- Plugin skills in `skills/` compose multiple MCP tools into guided workflows; they run as Claude Code skill prompts, not as MCP protocol extensions.

Install via: `/plugin marketplace add darylmcd/Roslyn-Backed-MCP` then `/plugin install roslyn-mcp@roslyn-mcp-marketplace`

## MCP Runtime Notes

- `stdout` is reserved for MCP protocol traffic.
- Operational logging should go to `stderr`.
- For custom stdio clients (not Cursor / Claude Code), see [`docs/stdio-client-integration.md`](../docs/stdio-client-integration.md) — covers NDJSON framing, init handshake, and minimal Python / C# client examples.

## Roslyn MCP client policy (AI sessions)

The Roslyn MCP server is the **default tool surface for all C# work in this repository**
— navigation, search, diagnostics, verification, AND structured edits. The policy is
three-part: read-side, write-side, and the bootstrap scope for self-edits.

### Read-side — prefer over Grep / Bash in every session (including bootstrap)

This is the most under-used quadrant. Every read tool listed below is safe under every
condition — including bootstrap self-edit on this repo — and is 5–30× faster than the
Bash / Grep alternative. The short answer is: **if your next action is "find / search /
locate / enumerate / verify / compile / test-targeted-subset", reach for the Roslyn MCP
tool first.**

Full pattern→tool mapping, session-verb triggers, and anti-pattern examples live in
[`ai_docs/bootstrap-read-tool-primer.md`](bootstrap-read-tool-primer.md). The primer is
intentionally short and greppable; bookmark it. The highest-leverage substitutions:

| Reach for… | Instead of… | Win |
|---|---|---|
| `compile_check` | `Bash: dotnet build` | 5–30× faster on loaded workspace; identical diagnostics |
| `test_related_files` + `test_run --filter` | `Bash: dotnet test --no-build` | ~2–5× faster; scoped to touched files |
| `find_references` / `find_consumers` / `find_implementations` | `Grep` for a symbol name | Symbol-identity exact; no same-simple-name false matches |
| `symbol_search` | `Grep` for a type / member name | Handles camelCase + FQN natively |
| `document_symbols` / `enclosing_symbol` | `Read` + eyeball | Semantic, not textual |

### Write-side — preview → apply on peer repos; bootstrap-restricted on this repo

When a Roslyn-backed refactor tool covers the edit (for example `rename_*`, `extract_*`,
`move_type_*`, `change_signature_*`, `code_fix_*`, `organize_usings_*`,
`bulk_replace_type_*`, `split_class_*`), use it on peer repositories in preference to
hand-editing multiple files or relying on text replacement. Use `*_preview` first,
review the diff, then call `*_apply` with the returned handle. Align with
[Session And Mutation Safety](#session-and-mutation-safety) (workspace id, version
checks).

### Bootstrap scope — self-edit on THIS repository

The self-edit bootstrap caveat restricts **write-side `*_apply` tools** when — and only
when — the binary servicing the MCP call is the same binary whose source tree is being
edited. There are two concrete shapes this takes in day-to-day work:

#### Main-checkout self-edit (restricted)

Running `dotnet run --project src/RoslynMcp.Host.Stdio` (or a freshly rebuilt
`roslynmcp` whose source IS the main checkout) against a workspace loaded from that
same checkout. Here `*_apply` is forbidden — the binary under edit is servicing the
call, so any apply mutates files underneath a stale `MSBuildWorkspace` snapshot.

- ❌ `*_apply` (rename_apply, extract_type_apply, create_file_apply, etc.) — use
  `Edit` / `Write`.
- ✅ `*_preview` — still useful for visualizing the diff before you hand-edit.
- ✅ **Every read-side tool** — see the primer.

#### Worktree self-edit (the `workflow.md` default — `*_apply` is safe)

Subagent sessions spawned under `backlog-sweep-execute.md` (and most other task work)
run inside a `.worktrees/<id>/` worktree against the **installed global tool** at
`%USERPROFILE%\.dotnet\tools\roslynmcp.exe` — the running binary is a distinct, already-
built artifact that is NOT mutated by edits to the worktree source tree. The binary-
under-edit rationale does not hold.

- ✅ `*_apply` — safe, and preferred when a refactoring tool covers the operation
  (rename, extract/move type, code fix, bulk type replace, organize usings, format).
- ✅ `*_preview` — use first; review the diff; then apply.
- ✅ **Every read-side tool** — same as above.

Discipline requirements for worktree `*_apply`:

1. Load the worktree's own solution — `workspace_load` on `.worktrees/<id>/RoslynMcp.slnx`,
   not the main-checkout path. Mixing them up applies edits to the wrong tree.
2. If a subsequent tool call depends on the post-apply state, call `workspace_reload`
   (or rely on the server's change tracker) to refresh the snapshot. This is the
   ordinary peer-repo discipline, not a bootstrap-specific constraint.

The canonical session-verb → tool table is in
[`bootstrap-read-tool-primer.md`](bootstrap-read-tool-primer.md) — agents should read
that file at session start alongside the other bootstrap docs.

### When the server is disconnected

Check `server_info` or try any `mcp__roslyn__*` call. If the server reports "not
connected", the Grep / Bash fallbacks in the primer's fallback column are appropriate.
Log the disconnect in the PR description and follow up with the
`mcp-connection-session-resilience` diagnostics.

For the full long-form decision tree across every tool (including the read-side list
above + all write-side tools + skill composites), see
[`domains/tool-usage-guide.md`](domains/tool-usage-guide.md).

## Known issues (local validation)

- **Parallel test hosts / MSBuild file locks:** If `dotnet test` or `dotnet build` fails with errors copying the test assembly (`RoslynMcp.Tests.dll`) because `testhost.exe` still holds the file, close other test runners or IDE test sessions that loaded that output, then run a full `dotnet test RoslynMcp.slnx --nologo` again from a clean state.
- **Stale `MetadataReference` after a cross-restore reload (rare):** On workspaces where an out-of-process `dotnet restore` bumps a transitive package version between `workspace_load` and a subsequent tool call, the server can — in rare cases — surface spurious `CS1705` "assembly uses higher version" errors from `compile_check`. The Item #7 remediation fires a `WorkspaceReloaded` event that drops the server's per-workspace `Compilation`, diagnostic, DI-scan, and NuGet-vuln caches synchronously with every `workspace_reload`, which eliminates the in-server cache as a suspect. If the symptom still reproduces after a `workspace_reload`, close the workspace and call `workspace_load` again — recreating the underlying `MSBuildWorkspace` forces Roslyn itself to re-resolve every `MetadataReference` from disk.

## Server surface (live counts)

The current stable/experimental tool, resource, and prompt counts are owned by the live `server_info` tool and the `roslyn://server/catalog` resource — query those for an authoritative answer rather than relying on this document. As of catalog `2026.04` (post v1.18.0):

- Stable tools: 102
- Experimental tools: 40
- Stable resources: 9 (3 static + 6 workspace-scoped templates, including the verbose siblings of `roslyn://workspaces` and `roslyn://workspace/{id}/status` added in v1.8 for opt-in full payloads)
- Experimental resources: 1 (`roslyn://workspace/{id}/file/{path}/lines/{N-M}` line-range slice added in v1.15)
- Experimental prompts: 20 (includes `refactor_loop` added in v1.18)

Resource discovery for clients that only call `resources/list`: workspace-scoped resources are exposed as URI templates (`roslyn://workspace/{workspaceId}/...`). Read `roslyn://server/resource-templates` for the canonical list of supported URI patterns.

## Workspace session lifetime

- Sessions are kept entirely in-memory by the stdio host. There is **no inactivity TTL** and no idle expiration — `KeyNotFoundException` from a workspace-scoped tool means the host process restarted, `workspace_close` was called, or the concurrent-workspace cap forced an eviction (`ROSLYNMCP_MAX_WORKSPACES`, default 8).
- Recovery is to call `workspace_load` again with the same path; the call is idempotent for repeated loads.
- Some MCP clients (Cursor, Claude Code) may relaunch the stdio server transparently between conversations, which is the most common cause of "lost" sessions.
- **Consumer ordering — call `workspace_load` first.** Transport-reachable does not imply workspace-loaded. Before invoking any workspace-scoped tool (`symbol_search`, `find_references`, `compile_check`, etc.), either (a) call `workspace_load` with the target `.sln` / `.slnx` / `.csproj` path, or (b) poll `server_heartbeat` (cheaper) or the `connection` subfield of `server_info` until `state == "ready"` and `loadedWorkspaceCount >= 1`. The `connection` block also surfaces `stdioPid` and `serverStartedAt` so consumers can correlate readiness with the current host process and detect silent restarts.

## Connection-state signals

Consumers and skills frequently infer "is the server connected / ready?" from the wrong signals. Use the authoritative probes, not filesystem or tool-list side effects.

**Authoritative probes (reliable):**

- `server_info` — full payload including the `connection` subfield (`state`, `stdioPid`, `serverStartedAt`, `loadedWorkspaceCount`). Use when a rich response is needed.
- `server_heartbeat` — lightweight readiness probe added in v1.21.x (`mcp-connection-session-resilience`, PR #218). Use for fast polling / readiness gates.
- Any successful `mcp__roslyn__*` tool call — proves live connectivity by construction.

**NOT reliable connection indicators — do not infer state from these:**

- `mcp-logs-<server>/` cache-directory presence. The directory is created on tool install, not on connect — it persists across disconnects and across host-process restarts.

## Session And Mutation Safety

- Maintain and pass `workspaceId` for workspace-scoped operations.
- Use preview/apply flows for destructive or broad changes.
- Reject or regenerate previews if workspace version changed.
