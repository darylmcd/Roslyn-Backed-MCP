# Next work and backlog

<!-- purpose: Open work only; contract for agents syncing backlog on ship. -->
<!-- scope: in-repo -->

**updated_at:** 2026-04-25T18:20:17Z

## Agent contract

**Scope:** this file lists unfinished work only. It is not a changelog.

| | |
|---|---|
| **MUST** | Remove or update backlog rows when work ships; do it in the same PR or an immediate follow-up. |
| **MUST** | End implementation plans with a final todo: `backlog: sync ai_docs/backlog.md`. |
| **MUST** | Use stable, kebab-case `id` values per open row. |
| **MUST NOT** | Add completed tables, dated history sections, or narrative changelogs here. |
| **MUST NOT** | Leave done items in the open table. |

## Standing rules

- Reprioritize on each audit pass.
- Keep rows terse: summarize the current need, not the full session history.
- Keep rows planner-ready: name live anchors and the next concrete deliverable or investigation output.
- Replace stale umbrella rows with concrete follow-ons before planning against them.
- Put long-form audit evidence in the referenced reports, not in this file.
- Size every row to a single `backlog-sweep-plan.md` initiative: one code path, ≤4 production files, ≤3 test files, one regression-test shape. Split heroic multi-bug rows into per-bug children before a sweep runs against them.

## P2 — open work

| id | pri | deps | do |
|----|-----|------|-----|

## P3 — open work

| id | pri | deps | do |
|----|-----|------|-----|
| `ci-test-parallelization-audit` | P3 | — | Refresh the old test-parallelization audit around the real residual issue: `eng/verify-release.ps1` still has 3 pre-existing cleanup-race flakes even though the `[DoNotParallelize]` sweep is already done. Start by reproducing and naming the failing tests, then localize whether the race sits in `tests/RoslynMcp.Tests/AssemblyCleanup.cs`, `tests/RoslynMcp.Tests/TestBase.cs`, or another teardown path before planning the fix plus a repeated-release stress gate (`eng/verify-release-stress.ps1` / CI). |
| `pretooluse-apply-preview-token-invariant` | P3 | — | The `PreToolUse:mcp__roslyn__*_apply` hook at `hooks/hooks.json` still scans the session transcript for a matching `*_preview` and false-positive-blocks `*_apply` 8 times across 4 refactor sessions in the 2026-04-10→04-24 retro (`format_range_apply`, `extract_interface_apply`, `create_file_apply`, `fix_all_apply`, `move_type_to_file_apply`) — prior work (PR #234, PR #230) softened cold-subagent and composite-preview cases but the structural scan remains. Return a short-lived `previewToken` on every `*_preview` response and require it on every `*_apply`; rewrite the hook to validate by token presence instead of transcript grep. Anchors: `src/RoslynMcp.Roslyn/Services/PreviewStore.cs` (already issues tokens for most previews — extend to the remaining preview tools), `src/RoslynMcp.Host.Stdio/Tools/*Apply*.cs` (add required `previewToken` parameter on every `*_apply`), `hooks/hooks.json` (flip scan → token compare). Distinct from `format-range-apply-preview-token-lifetime` (that row tunes token lifetime; this row tightens the apply-gate invariant). |
| `roslyn-mcp-sister-tool-name-aliases` | P3 | — | Agents repeatedly call Roslyn tools with python-refactor names and hit `<tool_use_error>Error: No such tool available: mcp__roslyn__<name></tool_use_error>` — 6 occurrences in the 2026-04-10→04-24 retro across `get_symbol_outline` (→ `document_symbols`), `find_duplicated_code` (→ `find_duplicated_methods` / `find_duplicate_helpers`), `get_test_coverage_map` (→ `test_coverage`). Register thin aliases in `src/RoslynMcp.Host.Stdio/Catalog/ServerSurfaceCatalog.cs` (and the relevant `ServerSurfaceCatalog.*.cs` partials) so agents land on the canonical tool with a deprecation-hint field in the response pointing at the new name. Low LOC; high DX payoff. |
| `find-type-consumers-file-granularity-rollup` | P3 | — | Agents looking for "which files touch this type" fall back to Grep (≥5 refactor sessions in the 2026-04-10→04-24 retro: 57a0d696, bfe7443f, ac8b4d93, 08adc1f1, b3e4cb62) because `find_references` returns per-site hits with no per-file rollup. Add `find_type_consumers(typeName, limit) → [{filePath, kinds: [using|ctor|inherit|field|local], count}]` on top of the existing reference index. Anchors: `src/RoslynMcp.Roslyn/Services/ReferenceService.cs` (reuse reference index), new tool in `src/RoslynMcp.Host.Stdio/Tools/SymbolTools.cs`. Shape mirrors what downstream rename/move/delete planning flows already want. |
| `skills-remove-server-heartbeat-polling` | P4 | — | The `/roslyn-mcp:complexity` skill (and any wait-loop in sibling skills under `.claude/plugins/roslyn-mcp/skills/`) polls `mcp__roslyn__server_heartbeat` in a loop — one session in the 2026-04-10→04-24 retro (b5464409) logged 78 heartbeat calls inside a single `/complexity` invocation; two others logged 8 and 6. Audit the shipped skill prompts and replace poll-until-ready with a single `server_info` check (or `workspace_status` + bounded backoff) so transcripts aren't inflated by heartbeat noise. Anchors: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (plugin manifest at repo root) + `skills/complexity/SKILL.md`, cross-check with `skills/*/SKILL.md` for the same pattern. |
| `stdio-host-stdout-audit` | P3 | — | MCP best-practices (2026-04 ref): stdio servers must NOT write to stdout — the framing channel shares it. A stray `Console.WriteLine` / `Console.Out.Write` in `src/RoslynMcp.Host.Stdio/` would surface as transport closure (matches some of the `MCP error -32000: Connection closed` errors seen in the 2026-04-10→04-24 retro). Grep the host tree for `Console.Write`, `Console.Out.`, `stdout.Write`, `Trace.WriteLine` (default TraceListener writes stdout); route any hits through the existing `ILogger` (stderr). Add an analyzer or test that asserts no direct stdout writes in `src/RoslynMcp.Host.Stdio/**/*.cs`. |
| `tool-annotation-population-audit` | P4 | — | MCP best-practices: tools should declare `readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint` / `idempotentHint` / `openWorldHint` annotations so clients (including the PreToolUse apply-gate hook) can route decisions off structured metadata instead of tool-name patterns. Verify via `server_info.surface` + a spot-check on `src/RoslynMcp.Host.Stdio/Tools/*Apply*.cs` and `*Preview*.cs` whether the `[McpServerTool]` attributes already carry these. If missing, populate: every `*_apply` → `destructiveHint: true`; every `*_preview` / read-shape tool → `readOnlyHint: true`; workspace-scoped tools → `openWorldHint: false`. Close-immediately if already populated. |
| `response-format-json-markdown-parameter` | P4 | — | MCP best-practices: summary-shaped tools should support `response_format: "json" \| "markdown"` (default `json` preserves wire compatibility). Current state: all 161 tools return JSON only. Highest-value candidates (heavy context cost, human-readable reframing): `server_info`, `workspace_list`, `workspace_status`, `validate_workspace`, `symbol_impact_sweep`, `project_diagnostics(summary)`. Add the parameter + markdown formatter per tool; start with `validate_workspace` (typically 120-line JSON → ~30-line table). Anchors: `src/RoslynMcp.Host.Stdio/Tools/ServerTools.cs`, `WorkspaceTools.cs`, `ValidationBundleTools.cs`. |
| `pretooluse-block-release-critical-file-edits` | P3 | — | Accidental agent edits to `Directory.Build.props`, `BannedSymbols.txt`, the 5 version files (`src/*/**.csproj` `<Version>` properties + `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` + `eng/verify-version-drift.ps1` baseline), `hooks/hooks.json` itself, and `eng/verify-skills-are-generic.ps1` have shipped drift historically (cross-ref: 1.28.0 parallel-PR changelog-append friction). Add a PreToolUse hook in `hooks/hooks.json` matching `Edit\|Write\|MultiEdit` on those specific paths that blocks with an actionable override phrase ("release-managed file; run `/bump` or `/release-cut` instead, or include 'ack: release-managed' in the edit rationale to proceed"). Keep the list in the hook config; document in `ai_docs/workflow.md`. |
| `posttool-verify-skills-on-shipped-skill-edits` | P4 | — | `eng/verify-skills-are-generic.ps1` is gated by `just ci` + `verify-release.ps1`, so an `ai_docs/` / `eng/` / `backlog.md` leak inside a `./skills/**/SKILL.md` is caught at CI, not at edit-time — round-trip waste per retro observation. Add a PostToolUse hook on `Edit\|Write\|MultiEdit` matching `./skills/**` that runs `pwsh eng/verify-skills-are-generic.ps1` and surfaces violations the same turn. Timeout bounded (the script is <1s). |

## P4 — open work

| id | pri | deps | do |
|----|-----|------|-----|
| `project-mutation-preview-xml-formatting` | P4 | — | `add_package_reference_preview`, `set_project_property_preview`, `add_central_package_version_preview` emit collapsed single-line XML (`</PropertyGroup><ItemGroup>`, trailing whitespace) in preview diffs. Cosmetic but hurts review friction. Post-process the generated diff through a format pass in `src/RoslynMcp.Roslyn/Services/ProjectMutationService.cs` + `OrchestrationMsBuildXml.cs` (tool: `src/RoslynMcp.Host.Stdio/Tools/ProjectMutationTools.cs`). |
| `semantic-search-duplicate-results-and-fallback-signal` | P4 | — | `semantic_search("classes implementing IDisposable", limit=10)` returns `JobProcessor` twice (identical `fullyQualifiedName` + `symbolHandle`), and the description advertises a Debug fallback payload (`fallbackStrategy`, `matchKind` per result) that isn't actually returned. Deduplicate by `symbolHandle` and surface `Debug.fallbackStrategy` / `matchKind` fields in `src/RoslynMcp.Roslyn/Services/CodePatternAnalyzer.cs` (tool: `src/RoslynMcp.Host.Stdio/Tools/AdvancedAnalysisTools.cs:293` `semantic_search`; response DTO: `src/RoslynMcp.Core/Models/SemanticSearchResponseDto.cs`). |
| `test-related-files-empty-result-explainability` | P4 | — | `test_related_files` currently returns only `tests` + `dotnetTestFilter` (`src/RoslynMcp.Core/Models/RelatedTestsForFilesDto.cs`), so an empty result cannot distinguish "no tests exist" from "heuristic miss." Extend the response, or add a companion diagnostic mode, to report scanned test projects, heuristics attempted, and miss reasons for each changed file. |
| `test-related-files-service-refactor-underreporting` | P4 | — | `src/RoslynMcp.Roslyn/Services/TestDiscoveryService.cs` still underreports service-layer refactors because its fallback path leans too heavily on type-name / filename affinity. Broaden the heuristic for multi-file service changes so it can surface likely integration or neighboring service tests before returning empty, and validate against the `MutationAnalysisService` + `ScaffoldingService` and `CodePatternAnalyzer` + `TestDiscoveryService` misses seen in the 2026-04-23 sweep. |
| `workspace-process-pool-or-daemon` | P4 | `large-solution profile` | Do not start a daemon/process-pool implementation blindly. First capture representative 50+ project timings per `docs/large-solution-profiling-baseline.md`; only if `workspace_load` / reload P95 still blocks daily use after `workspace_warm` should the next plan produce a bounded design note comparing daemon, process-pool, and shared-workspace approaches, including lifecycle and failure-isolation hooks. |
| `semantic-grep-identifier-scoped-search` | P4 | — | Agents want to grep inside C# code but exclude string/comment matches — current Grep returns hits inside CHANGELOG, markdown, and string literals (3 Roslyn-self-audit sessions in the 2026-04-10→04-24 retro: 57a0d696, 08adc1f1, cf2d0b85). Add `semantic_grep(pattern, scope=identifiers|strings|comments|all, projectFilter?) → [{filePath, line, column, tokenKind, snippet}]` as a thin wrapper on `SyntaxTree.DescendantTokens` + `SyntaxToken.Kind()` + regex match. Anchors: new service under `src/RoslynMcp.Roslyn/Services/`, new tool in `src/RoslynMcp.Host.Stdio/Tools/AnalysisTools.cs`. Weaker evidence (3 sessions, all self-audit) — P4 until an external-repo session reproduces the pattern. |
