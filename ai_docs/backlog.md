# Next work and backlog

<!-- purpose: Open work only; contract for agents syncing backlog on ship. -->
<!-- scope: in-repo -->

## Agent contract

| | |
|---|---|
| **Scope** | This file lists unfinished work only. It is not a changelog. |
| **MUST** | Remove or update backlog rows when work ships; do it in the same PR or an immediate follow-up. |
| **MUST** | End implementation plans with a final todo: `backlog: sync ai_docs/backlog.md`. |
| **MUST** | Use stable, kebab-case `id` values per open row. |
| **MUST** | Every row's `do` cell summarizes the current need + the concrete next deliverable. Include `Anchors:` (specific source file paths) when the row references code, and evidence (audit/retro/CI signal) when one exists. |
| **MUST** | Size every row to a single bounded initiative — ≤4 production files, ≤3 test files, one regression-test shape. Split heroic multi-bug rows into per-bug children before planning against them. |
| **MUST NOT** | Add `Completed`, `Shipped`, `Done`, `History`, or `Changelog` sections. Git is the archive. |
| **MUST NOT** | Leave done items in the open table. |
| **MUST NOT** | Use `### <id>` body sections per item. The table row IS the canonical form. Items needing long-form depth (more than ~10 lines) link to `ai_docs/items/<id>.md` from the `do` cell. |

## Standing rules

- **Reprioritize on each audit pass.** Stale priority order is a finding.
- **Keep rows planner-ready.** A row is ready when an agent can read it cold and start a plan: name the live anchors and the next concrete deliverable or investigation output.
- **Replace stale umbrella rows with concrete follow-ons** before planning against them.
- **Long-form audit evidence belongs in referenced reports**, not in this file. The `do` cell carries a one-line evidence summary plus the report path.
- **Weak-evidence flag.** When a row's signal is thin (single retro session, self-audit only, etc.) say so explicitly in the `do` cell ("Weaker evidence — N until external session reproduces").
- **Priority tiers:** Critical > High > Medium > Low > Defer.
- See `workflow.md` → **Backlog closure** for close-in-PR expectations.

## Critical

<!-- Production-breaking or blocking work. Empty section is fine; keep the header. -->

| id | pri | deps | do |
|----|-----|------|-----|

## High

| id | pri | deps | do |
|----|-----|------|-----|

## Medium

| id | pri | deps | do |
|----|-----|------|-----|
| `ci-test-parallelization-audit` | Medium | — | Phase 1 triage named the historical PR #322 failures but did not reproduce them on the current checkout: 25 consecutive `eng/verify-release.ps1 -Configuration Release -NoCoverage` runs passed with 1001/1001 tests each. Evidence: `ai_docs/reports/test-parallelization-triage-2026-04-22.md`. Do not implement the old suspected teardown fix blindly; if a fresh flake appears, start with the still-risky manual isolated-copy path in `tests/RoslynMcp.Tests/IntegrationTests.cs` (`Preview_Token_Is_Rejected_After_Two_Reloads`) and ensure the loaded workspace is closed before deleting the copied root. Otherwise close or reclassify this row as stale evidence in the next docs/state follow-up. |
| `pretooluse-apply-preview-token-invariant` | Medium | — | The `PreToolUse:mcp__roslyn__*_apply` hook at `hooks/hooks.json` still scans the session transcript for a matching `*_preview` and false-positive-blocks `*_apply` 8 times across 4 refactor sessions in the 2026-04-10→04-24 retro (`format_range_apply`, `extract_interface_apply`, `create_file_apply`, `fix_all_apply`, `move_type_to_file_apply`) — prior work (PR #234, PR #230) softened cold-subagent and composite-preview cases but the structural scan remains. The 2026-04-26 multi-session retro reconfirms the same open finding as `preview-token-apply-gate` across sessions 34ca7601, 7e2befc9, 1d93dd85, d8763f40, and aef3fb58; keep this as the single deduped backlog row for that finding. Return a short-lived `previewToken` on every `*_preview` response and require it on every `*_apply`; rewrite the hook to validate by token presence instead of transcript grep. Anchors: `src/RoslynMcp.Roslyn/Services/PreviewStore.cs` (already issues tokens for most previews — extend to the remaining preview tools), `src/RoslynMcp.Host.Stdio/Tools/*Apply*.cs` (add required `previewToken` parameter on every `*_apply`), `hooks/hooks.json` (flip scan → token compare). Evidence: `ai_docs/reports/20260426T162740Z_roslyn-backed-mcp_roslyn-mcp-multisession-retro.md` §4 `preview-token-apply-gate`. Distinct from `format-range-apply-preview-token-lifetime` (that row tunes token lifetime; this row tightens the apply-gate invariant). |

## Low

| id | pri | deps | do |
|----|-----|------|-----|
| `tool-annotation-population-audit` | Low | — | MCP best-practices: tools should declare `readOnlyHint` / `destructiveHint` / `idempotentHint` / `openWorldHint` annotations so clients (including the PreToolUse apply-gate hook) can route decisions off structured metadata instead of tool-name patterns. Verify via `server_info.surface` + a spot-check on `src/RoslynMcp.Host.Stdio/Tools/*Apply*.cs` and `*Preview*.cs` whether the `[McpServerTool]` attributes already carry these. If missing, populate: every `*_apply` → `destructiveHint: true`; every `*_preview` / read-shape tool → `readOnlyHint: true`; workspace-scoped tools → `openWorldHint: false`. Close-immediately if already populated. |

## Defer

<!-- Explicitly parked. Record WHY in the `do` cell. -->

| id | pri | deps | do |
|----|-----|------|-----|
| `workspace-process-pool-or-daemon` | Defer | `large-solution profile` | Do not start a daemon/process-pool implementation blindly. First capture representative 50+ project timings per `docs/large-solution-profiling-baseline.md`; only if `workspace_load` / reload P95 still blocks daily use after `workspace_warm` should the next plan produce a bounded design note comparing daemon, process-pool, and shared-workspace approaches, including lifecycle and failure-isolation hooks. Deferred until profile evidence justifies the work. |
