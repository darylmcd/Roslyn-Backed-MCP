# Next work and backlog

<!-- purpose: Open work only; contract for agents syncing backlog on ship. -->

**updated_at:** 2026-04-11T12:00:00Z

## Agent contract

**Scope:** This file lists **unfinished work only**. It is not a changelog.

| | |
|---|---|
| **MUST** | Remove or update backlog rows when work ships; do it in the **same PR** as the implementation (or an immediate follow-up). |
| **MUST** | End implementation plans with a final todo: `backlog: sync ai_docs/backlog.md` when closing backlog-related items. |
| **MUST** | Use stable, kebab-case `id` values per open row (grep-friendly). |
| **MUST NOT** | Add "Completed" tables, dated history sections, or narrative changelogs here. |
| **MUST NOT** | Leave done items in the open table. |

## Standing rules (ongoing)

These are **not** backlog rows; do not delete them when clearing completed work.

- Reprioritize on each audit pass.
- Bug and tool items: put reproduction and session context in the PR or linked issue when it helps reviewers.
- Broader planning and complexity notes stay in this file; `ai_docs/archive/` holds policy only (see `archive/README.md`).

## Open work

Ordered by severity: P2 (contract violations / real-world blockers) → P3 (refactors, accuracy, UX) → P4 (docs + cosmetic).

| id | blocker | deps | do |
|----|---------|------|-----|

_All deep-review backlog rows shipped in PRs #121–#127. Next audit pass will refill with new findings._
