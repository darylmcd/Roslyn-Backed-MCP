# Tool Usage Guide for AI Agents

<!-- purpose: Help agents pick Roslyn MCP tools and preview/apply workflows. -->

This document helps AI agents choose the right tools and workflows for common tasks.
Call `discover_capabilities` with a category to get contextual guidance, or use `server_info` for a full capability overview.

**Policy:** Use the Roslyn MCP server for C# **refactoring** as well as discovery—see [`runtime.md`](../runtime.md) (*Roslyn MCP client policy*).

## Quick Decision Tree

**"I need to understand code"** → Start with `symbol_search`, `symbol_info`, `go_to_definition`, `document_symbols`

**"I need to find who uses X"** → `find_references` (single symbol), `find_references_bulk` (multiple), `find_consumers` (type-level dependency analysis)

**"I need to assess change impact"** → `impact_analysis` (reference-level), `find_consumers` (type-level with dependency kinds)

**"I need to check code quality"** → `get_complexity_metrics` (method complexity), `get_cohesion_metrics` (type cohesion/SRP), `find_unused_symbols` (dead code)

**"I need to refactor a type"** → See [SRP Refactoring Workflow](#srp-refactoring-workflow) below

**"I need to fix errors"** → `project_diagnostics` → `diagnostic_details` → `code_fix_preview` → `code_fix_apply`

**"I need to build/test"** → `build_workspace` (compile), `test_run` (run tests), `test_related_files` (targeted tests after changes)

## Verification workflow (post-edit default)

After any C# edit — `Edit`, `Write`, or `*_apply` — the default verification loop is the
Roslyn MCP **verify triple**, in order:

1. `compile_check` — structured diagnostics on the loaded workspace. Sub-second on a
   warm workspace; identical diagnostic coverage to `dotnet build` modulo analyzer
   packages (which are the same set this repo's MSBuild targets pull in).
2. `test_related_files` → `test_run --filter "<filter>"` — derive the test filter from
   the touched-file set, then run only the relevant subset. Returns in seconds instead
   of the minutes a full `dotnet test` takes.
3. `format_check` — confirm `dotnet format`-equivalent whitespace / using-ordering is
   clean on the touched files only.

Example (after editing `src/RoslynMcp.Roslyn/Services/SymbolSearchService.cs`):

```text
compile_check(workspaceId, projectFilter: "RoslynMcp.Roslyn")
test_related_files(workspaceId, filePaths: ["src/RoslynMcp.Roslyn/Services/SymbolSearchService.cs"])
  → returns filter "FullyQualifiedName~SymbolSearch"
test_run(workspaceId, filter: "FullyQualifiedName~SymbolSearch")
format_check(workspaceId, filePaths: ["src/RoslynMcp.Roslyn/Services/SymbolSearchService.cs"])
```

### Shell fallbacks — CI-parity only

Reach for these **only** when you need byte-identical CI parity (e.g., the final
`verify-release.ps1` check before cutting a release), or when the MCP server is
disconnected and the [fallback column in the primer](../bootstrap-read-tool-primer.md#pattern--tool-read-sideawayssafe)
applies:

- `Bash: dotnet build <sln> -c Release -p:TreatWarningsAsErrors=true` — full MSBuild
  cycle, ~5–30s; matches CI exactly.
- `Bash: dotnet test <testproj> -c Release --no-build` — full suite, minutes; matches
  CI exactly.
- `Bash: dotnet format --verify-no-changes` — full-solution formatter check.

Routine post-edit verify should **not** use the shell commands. The MCP triple returns
the same signal 5–30× faster and with structured output the caller can inspect without
re-parsing stdout.

## SRP Refactoring Workflow

The recommended workflow for Single Responsibility Principle refactoring:

```
1. ANALYZE:  get_cohesion_metrics  → Find types with LCOM4 > 1
2. PLAN:     find_shared_members   → Identify extraction dependencies
3. ASSESS:   find_consumers        → Understand blast radius
4. EXTRACT:  extract_type_preview  → Preview the member extraction
5. APPLY:    extract_type_apply    → Execute the extraction
6. ABSTRACT: extract_interface_preview → Create interface for the new type (optional)
7. MIGRATE:  bulk_replace_type_preview → Update consumers to use interface (optional)
8. VERIFY:   build_workspace       → Check compilation
9. TEST:     test_related_files    → Run affected tests
```

Use the `cohesion_analysis` prompt for a guided version of this workflow.

## Preview/Apply Pattern

Most write operations follow a two-step pattern:

1. **Preview** (`*_preview`) — Returns a diff and a `previewToken`. Inspect the changes.
2. **Apply** (`*_apply`) — Pass the `previewToken` to commit changes. Tokens expire after ~15 minutes.

If the workspace changes between preview and apply, the token becomes stale and the apply will fail.
Always call `build_workspace` after applying changes.

## Undo

`revert_last_apply(workspaceId)` rolls back the **most recent** `*_apply`
operation on a workspace. Coverage includes renames, code fixes, format,
organize usings, `apply_text_edit` / `apply_multi_file_edit`, and the
file-level apply tools (`create_file_apply`, `delete_file_apply`,
`move_file_apply`, `extract_interface_apply`, `extract_type_apply`,
`move_type_to_file_apply`). A second `revert_last_apply` call in the same
session does **not** undo the one before it — the history is depth-1.

### revert_last_apply — side-effect cleanup

`revert_last_apply` reverts **text edits** from the last `*_apply`. It does
**NOT** remove files created as a side effect of that apply. Specifically,
the extracted file that `extract_type_apply`, `extract_method_apply`, or
`extract_interface_apply` wrote to disk stays on disk after the revert —
the extracted symbol is restored to its original location, but the new
file is now an orphan. Any other `*_apply` that creates new files has the
same shape.

**Canonical follow-up:** call `delete_file_apply` on the extracted file to
finish the undo.

**Worked example:**

```text
extract_type_apply(..., newTypeName: "Foo")
  → moves Foo out of Bar.cs into new file Foo.cs.
revert_last_apply(workspaceId)
  → Bar.cs is restored (Foo's members move back in),
    BUT Foo.cs still exists on disk (now empty of the extracted symbol
    or a leftover scaffold, depending on what the extract wrote).
delete_file_apply(workspaceId, filePath: ".../Foo.cs")
  → removes Foo.cs. Workspace is now byte-identical to the pre-extract state.
```

The same pattern applies to `extract_method_apply` (if the method lands in
a new partial file) and `extract_interface_apply` (the new interface file
on disk).

## Error Recovery

- **"Preview token is stale"** — The workspace changed since the preview. Re-run the preview.
- **"Workspace is not loaded"** — Call `workspace_load` first.
- **"Symbol not found"** — Verify file path and line/column. Use `symbol_search` to find the correct location.
- **Build failures after refactoring** — Check `project_diagnostics` for the specific errors, then use `code_fix_preview` for automated fixes.
